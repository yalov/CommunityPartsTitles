# Prefixes in Use

## General Notes

### Diameters

Sizes are given in decimeters; therefore, 2.5m diameter is given as *25*. 10m
is given as *A0*, which is 100 in hexadecimal. Radial mounts are given a
"diameter" of *R*.

Typical sizes thus are given as *03*, *06*, *12*, *18*, *25*, *37*, *50*, *75*,
*A0*.

Parts intended for use in airplanes are sometimes denoted as *Mk0*, *Mk1*,
*Mk2*, or *Mk3*.

*Kerbodyne S3* is *37*, *Kerbodyne S4* is *50*.

If an item is two different sizes at the two ends, typically both sizes are
given, e.g. *12-25*. If an adapter has several mounting plates on one end, the
count of these plates is also provided; e.g. *37-25x4*.


### Magnitude

For volumes and ranges, a prefix of *k* means that the given number is in
thousands, and a prefix of *m* means the given number is in millions. Note that
these are prefixed, so sorting works as expected (e.g. "*XX-k03*).


### Source Designation

For commonly-provided parts (such as fuel tanks), often an abbreviation for the
source mod will be added after the part title, in parenthesis; e.g. *(RS+)*.

(Selected) designations thus used:

- FTP -- Fuel Tanks Plus
- Kerbonov
- N-Series -- Near Future Launch Vehicles
- Orion -- Stockish Project Orion
- SpaceY
- SR -- USI Sounding Rockets
- SSR -- MicroSat
- RLA -- RLA Reborn
- RS+ -- ReStock Plus


## Pods

*RC* ("Remote Control") is used as a prefix for probe cores.


## Engines

Engines have yet to be thoroughly standardized and thus still use a variety of
naming conventions.

If in doubt, you can use:

- *LV* ("Liquid Vector") for liquid fuel + oxidizer engines,
- *O* (the letter after *N*, rather than the number) for monopropellant
engines,
- *J* for jet engines,
- *IX* for Ion engines,

The exception is solid rocket boosters, that are named "SRB-*diameter*-*fuel
amount*".


## Tanks

Tanks are named "*prefix*-*diameter*-*volume* 'nice' name".

(Selected) prefixes used:

- *FL* ("Fuel Level") -- regular liquid fuel + oxidizer tanks
- *FS* -- single-ended liquid fuel + oxidizer tanks
- *FV* -- adapter liquid fuel + oxidizer tanks; i.e. tanks that have different
  diameters top and bottom
- *OL* -- for monopropellant tanks
- *Ar* -- for Argon tanks
- *Li* -- for Lithium tanks
- *Xe* -- for Xenon tanks
- *UH* -- Holding tanks (for Ore)
- *NL* ("Nuclear Liquid") -- liquid fuel only tanks, for use with Nuclear engines
- *YD* -- Hydrogen Tanks


## Other Parts

- *Adapter* -- Adaptor Plates. Multiple sizes are split by a vertical bar, listed from smallest to largest, e.g. "Adapter 50-12|25|37"

- *AV* -- fins and wings
- *C* -- Antennas (stock)

- *G* -- Hinge
- *HS* -- Heat Shield
- *I* -- Lights ("Illuminator")
- *IN* -- Intakes (like for air for jet engines)
- *KX* -- Solar Panels, surface/radial mounted (that don't require deployment) (c.f. *OX* and *SP*)
